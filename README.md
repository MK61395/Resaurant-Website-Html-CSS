This project is a food website based on 4 pages, similar to a restaurant site like KFC. The design is creative and original, not copying any existing theme.

Pages
Page 1: Login/Sign-up
This page includes a login panel with username and password fields, as well as a sign-up or registration panel with all necessary user information. After logging in or signing up, the user is redirected to the main page of the website.

Page 2: Home/Main page
This page provides a general introduction to the website, using proper divisions and including images and text for a creative starting page. It also contains the menu of the restaurant, with each item having a description and an ‘Add to Cart’ button. There are also different deals with their names, prices, and descriptions. Each deal has an ‘Add to Cart’ button.

Page 3: Cart
This page contains the chosen items along with their prices, as well as the total calculated bill at the end. There is also a ‘Proceed to payment’ button to navigate to the payment page.

Page 4: Payment
This page contains a form that takes detailed customer information as input, including name, contact number, email, shipping address, and payment method. There is also a ‘Place an order’ button that navigates back to the homepage.

Design
The website follows a single theme with a consistent header and footer on every page. The navigation bar is in the header and contains the logo and names of the pages. The footer contains contact information such as number, email, address(s), and social media pages.

Technologies
The project uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front-end design. No templates or paid libraries were used in the creation of this project.
